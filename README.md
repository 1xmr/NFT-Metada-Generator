# Features
- [X] Generate Metadata JSON files and save them automatically.
- [X] Generate NFT images with custom probabilities and save them automatically.
- [X] Check the possibilities and get informed if the requested numbers match the 
  probabilities.
- [X] Completely customizable project name, file extension, project description, NFT 
  numbering, etc.

# Setup
1. Environment setup:
- The current code was run on Python 3.11.0, but it should work on Python 3.8+. Make 
  sure to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.
```zsh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Requirements:
- Put all of your images in the `app/images` folder. The images should be named the 
  same as the trait names in the `rarity.json` file. For example, if you have a trait named 
  as `Golden` in the `rarity.json` file, you should have a `Golden.png` image in the 
  trait folders. Any name mismatch will cause the script to fail.
- The folder names in `app/images` should be renamed to the trait category names in the 
  `rarity.json` file. For example, if you have a trait category named as 
  `Background` or `Skin` etc. in `rarity.json`, you should have a `Background` folder in
  the `app/images` folder as well. Any name mismatch will cause the script to fail.
- All of the images in the `app/images` folder should be the same size. Any size mismatch 
  will NOT cause the script to fail, however, final images will be distorted.
- `rarity.json` file should be in the `app` folder. The structure of the file is 
  explained in the [docs](docs/README.md) folder, `README.md` file.
- Finally when running the `launcher.py` to generate all of the NFTs, make sure to 
  be in the correct directory and the path, which is:
```zsh
$ cd app/
$ pwd

> nft-and-metadata-generator/app/
```

3. Streamlit GUI Setup and Usage:
```zsh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd app/

$ pwd

> nft-and-metadata-generator/app/

$ streamlit run streamlit_gui_generator.py

# Usage
- To generate all of the NFTs, run the `launcher.py` file after modifying `rarity.
  json` and putting all of the necessary images in the `app/images` folder. Make 
  sure to read #Setup section before running the script:
```zsh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

$ python launcher.py
```
- According to the number of NFTs you want to generate, the script will generate 
  the NFTs and save them in the `app/nfts` folder. It will also generate the 
  metadata JSON files and save them in the `app/metadata` folder. It might take some 
  time to generate all of the NFTs, so be patient. You can follow the progress 
  throughout the logs.
